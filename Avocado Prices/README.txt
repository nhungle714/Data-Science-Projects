As much as avocado toasts are in high demand, it is interesting to see whether the avocado prices fluctuate across different regions in the US.
This data set is from HassAvocado Board (http://www.hassavocadoboard.com/retail/volumeand- price-data) that records average prices of 
conventional and organic avocado in different regions from December 2014 to April 2018. The goal of this exercise is to forecast 
avocado prices in different regions given historical average avocado prices by region and by type (i.e., conventional vs. organic).
