This project focuses on classifiying the lung disease using chest x-ray dataset provided by NIH (https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-clinical-center-provides-one-largest-publicly-available-chest-x-ray-datasets-scientific-community). The goal is to classify pneumothorax and cardiomegaly cases, using deep CNN models 1) customized convolutional ResNet and 2) transfered learning resnet 34. I used HPC at NYU to train the models.
