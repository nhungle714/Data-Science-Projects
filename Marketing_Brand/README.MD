A leader in the F&B industry is trying to optimize its marketing actions. The goal of this project is to provide
valuable Ã­nsights on how sales of different brands and products respond to promotions and different
marketing features applied in each promotion. Should we find significant marketing features on each product
/ brand, it would be interesting to build a predictive model that would maximize sales for each product.
