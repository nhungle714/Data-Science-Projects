# Data-Science-Projects

This folder contains my personal data science projects. In addition to code and my write-up (mostly in the form of Ipython notebook or PDF file), I also include links to materials related to the models / concepts used. I hope to cover various topics and apply different models and techniques to optimize the learning experience.
